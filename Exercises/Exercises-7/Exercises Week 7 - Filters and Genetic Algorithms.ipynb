    "This exercise aims at helping you understand the basic components that make up a genetic algorithm (GA). A general GA has 3 basic operations, that is: selection, crossover, mutation. In this exercise you will go through all of these operation and implement them. You will also encounter a very common issue in optimization which is selecting a proper fitness function that will smoothly guide your search algorithm to a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with the exercise take a look at the following [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/evolution-of-a-salesman-a-complete-genetic-algorithm-tutorial-for-python-6fe5d2b3ca35) and the corresponding [code](https://github.com/ezstoltz/genetic-algorithm).\n",

    "\n",
    "![title](res/map.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task you can use a GA whose individuals would represent a series of movements in the map. Each gene is a simple movement primitive in on direction (i.e., North, West, South, East). You can draw inspiration from the tutorial you just read and even use whole blocks of code to solve the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you follow the following instructions to solve the exercise, but if you feel that this is too constrained you may alter the structure completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps for solving the exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Familiarize yourself with GAs and study the use of the selection, crossover and mutation operations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Implement the MapNode class to hold information concerning a node of the grid. This would include coordinates and the obstacle flag.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. The code to recreate the map of the above image is already provided.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Implement each missing component (selection, crossover, mutation) at a time by commenting the rest. The problem is simple enough for you to manually test if your implementation is correct.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. Once you feel confident that your basic GA structure is working you will need to construct a good fitness function. **No** there is no perfect fitness function for this problem. You will need to try and fail in order to find one that works. You will also need to implement an appropriate crossover or mutation to guide the search.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6. Allow your GA to run for lots of generations (~ 2000). Although it might seem simple and low dimensional, evolving the optimal solution is not trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. Once you are confident that your GA is working, use the plot function that is already provided (and update its generation, population, etc parameters) to visualize the evolution of the fitness over generations. Remember that GAs work in a stochastic manner. This means that you should run your GA at least a few times (say 5) and keep the fitness vs generation plot before you can draw conclusions about the performance of the algorithm and the difficulty of the task you have.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
